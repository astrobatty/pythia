    Scargle periodogram of Scargle (1982).

    # TODO: Update normalisation options
    Several options are available (possibly combined):
        2. Amplitude spectrum
        3. Distribution power spectrum
        4. Traditional power spectrum
        5. Power density spectrum (see Kjeldsen, 2005 or Carrier, 2010)

    This definition makes use of a Fortran-routine written by Jan Cuypers, Conny
    Aerts and Peter De Cat. A slightly adapted version is used for the weighted
    version (adapted by Pieter Degroote).

    Through the option "norm", it's possible to norm the periodogram as to get a
    periodogram that has a known statistical distribution. Usually, this norm is
    the variance of the data (NOT of the noise or residuals, see Schwarzenberg-
    Czerny 1998!).

    Also, it is possible to retrieve the power density spectrum in units of
    [ampl**2/frequency]. In this routine, the normalisation constant is taken
    to be the total time span T. Kjeldsen (2005) chooses to multiply the power
    by the 'effective length of the observing run', which is calculated as the
    reciprocal of the area under spectral window (in power, and take 2*Nyquist
    as upper frequency value).

    As of 09/11/2018, this routine has been stripped and updated to work in python 2.7
    and python 3.6. Additionally, the routines are updated to function as generators.

    REMARK: this routine does B{not} automatically remove the average. It is the
    user's responsibility to do this adequately: e.g. subtract a B{weighted}
    average if one computes the weighted periodogram!!

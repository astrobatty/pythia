timeseries/periodograms -- library containing functions for time-series analysis


Before installing, you must modify the contents of the yml file!
At the bottom, the prefix variable currently says: /YOUR/PATH/TO/miniconda3...
This needs to be changed to reflect the location of miniconda3 (or anaconda3)
in your directory structure.

To install, use miniconda3 or anaconda3, and run:
        conda env create -f pythia.yml


TO DO:
  Include GUI support
  Include Gaussian Processes
